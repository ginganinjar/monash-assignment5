Day Planner
This web application functions as an event planner for a day. Included is an interactive callender.

Installation
Clone the folder onto your own computer by forking the repository and using the "Clone or download" button on github.

Functionality
Current time sensitivity
The calendar spans the entire time spectrum. The current date is displayed at the top of the planner. Historical events are
greyed out and cannot be edited. The system polls for the first upcoming event and displays it accordingly. This app would
be far more usable if it had email integration, which I may do, if I have tine.

The intent of this APP was to provide a true and genuine feel of a sleek and simple interface with the functionality to 
make a usable and functioning interface.

## Compatibility
### Compiled state
- IE 10+
- Firefox 32+ (maybe lower)
- Chrome 32+ (maybe lower)
- Chromium 43+ (I think it will be same like Chrome but I don't have chance to test lower versions)
- Opera 30+ (maybe lower)
- Edge 14+
- Safari 9+ (awful browser it's like new IE)
- Brave - all version - (I highly recommend Brave given it's compatibility with Chrome plugins) 


Installation
Use git to clone the project using the repository :git@github.com:ginganinjar/monash-assignment5.git

git clone git@github.com:ginganinjar/monash-assignment5.git

Usage
As it stands this is basically unusable. It would be nice if it was integrated with a callander app or if an API was 
written. Also would be useful to integrate with a web based CRM.


Acceptance Criteria
// GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
// WHEN I open the planner
// THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
// WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
// THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
// WHEN I click into a timeblock
// THEN I can enter an event
// WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
// THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
// WHEN I refresh the page
