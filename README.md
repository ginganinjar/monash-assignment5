The Quiz

Just another online questionare. Nice background effect with some jazzy animations. 
Live Demo : (https://ginganinjar.github.io/monash-assignment4/index.html)

## Compatibility
### Compiled state
- IE 10+
- Firefox 32+ (maybe lower)
- Chrome 32+ (maybe lower)
- Chromium 43+ (I think it will be same like Chrome but I don't have chance to test lower versions)
- Opera 30+ (maybe lower)
- Edge 14+
- Safari 9+ (awful browser it's like new IE)
- Brave - all version - (I highly recommend Brave given it's compatibility with Chrome plugins) 


By gamifying the process of a quiz, it is hoped that users enjoy learning with a repitive and constant challenge to beat the previous score. The beautiful background 9Nightsky with twinking stars) was taken from here, https://codepen.io/WebSonick/pen/vjmgu although significant customisation here would suggest you'd be better to go to the source.

Installation
Use git to clone the project using the repository : git@github.com:ginganinjar/monash-assignment4.git

git clone git@github.com:ginganinjar/monash-assignment4.git

Usage
The application game can be customised by adding questions into the file questions-array.js. Sound can be turned off/on by using the speaker icon and the leaderboard saves the score on the localstorage of the users machine.
